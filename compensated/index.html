      <h1>Compensated</h1>
<p>Build products. Get paid.</p>
<h2>Why Use Compensated</h2>
<p>Services like Stripe, Gumroad, Paypal, Apple Pay and other payment processors go a long way towards creating powerful, useful APIs for handling financial transactions.
However, implementing their APIs directly can make it expensive to switch or add vendors.</p>
<p>On the other hand, implementing a layer of indirection to mitigate that cost takes time and energy. Each provider uses different data structures with different design priorities and different event sequences.</p>
<p>Compensated provides that layer of indirection for you, so you can focus on creating value for your customers.</p>
<h2>How Compensated Works</h2>
<p>Compensated is a Ruby gem that you can include directly in your existing Ruby projects, or host as a thin adapter to normalize events as they stream in. Think of it like <a href="https://www.nylas.com/">Nylas</a>, <a href="https://www.yodlee.com/">Yodlee</a>, <a href="https://plaid.com/">Plaid</a>, or <a href="https://github.com/thoughtbot/griddler">Griddler</a>; but for getting paid.</p>
<p>Compensated is currently in alpha, with a few production installations.</p>
<h2>Get Compensated</h2>
<h3>Buy a License</h3>
<p>Compensated is licensed under a traditional licensing model, where you buy it once and are able to use it forever. During the alpha, Compensated is $500, which grants you usage rights for all the <code>0.X</code> and <code>1.X</code> versions.</p>
<p>Buy a license by <a href="mailto:info+compensated@zinc.coop">emailing us directly</a>.</p>
<h3>Support</h3>
<p>You can open an issue in our <a href="https://github.com/zinc-collective/compensated/issues">issue tracker</a>, <a href="mailto:info+compensated@zinc.coop">reach out</a> for direct support, or schedule a o-e hour pair programming session with one of the maintainers. Paid support is $85 per hour while we are in Alpha.</p>
<h3>Read the Source, Luke</h3>
<p>All our <a href="https://github.com/zinc-collective/compensated">source code</a> is publicly available. But we are <em>not</em> Open Source.
Paying for licenses allows us to maintain and update Compensated for everyone.
Further, this allows us to refuse to grant a license to organizations who participate in the surveillance, incarceration, oil, or weapons industries; or otherwise violate human rights.</p>
